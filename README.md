Welcome to **Agents with ADK**!  
This repository is a collection of AI agents built using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK). Each agent demonstrates practical use cases and serves as a foundation for building, customizing, and integrating intelligent agents into Python applications.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- Multiple agent implementations (currently: `social_media_agent`; more coming soon)
- Modular, extensible architecture for easy addition of new agents
- Ready-to-use agent templates and integration examples
- Designed for modern Python workflows

2. **Set up your environment and install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    python -m venv .venv
